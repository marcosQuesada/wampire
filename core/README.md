WAMP protocol implementation [WIP]
==================================
 Proof of concept on a basic WAMP library, it's heavily inspired on WAMP Turnpike implementation.
 Why do this? Just for the sake of coding :)
 
 
## Milestones
 * WAMP basic server (supports HELLO/WELCOME, SUBSCRIBE/SUBSCRIBED, PUBLISH/PUBLISHED)
 * WAMP RPC dealer (supports CALL / RESULT)
